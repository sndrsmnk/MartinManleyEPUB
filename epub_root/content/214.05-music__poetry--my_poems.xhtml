    <p class="normal0">I&#x27;m no poet and I know it.</p>

    <p class="normal0">Nevertheless, I&#x27;ve written a few poems that I happen to like. See what you think.</p>

    <p class="normal0">This is the first poem that I ever remember writing.</p>

    <p class="normal0">Old Saint Nick (1966, Age 13)</p>

    <p class="normal0">One Christmas Eve when I was sick</p>

    <p class="normal0">I looked out my window and saw Saint Nick</p>

    <p class="normal0">I ran to my bed and closed my eyes</p>

    <p class="normal0">And, down through the chimney the old man arrives</p>

    <p class="normal0">I peeked through the door and Santa Clause said</p>

    <p class="normal0">You little sick boy, please stay in bed</p>

    <p class="normal0">Five minutes later I woke back up</p>

    <p class="normal0">And, there beside me lay a pup</p>

    <p class="normal0">I could hardly sleep until Christmas day</p>

    <p class="normal0">Even my dreams would keep me awake</p>

    <p class="normal0">But, Christmas morn came and I felt so much better</p>

    <p class="normal0">I could not wait to write Nick a letter</p>

    <p class="normal0">From that day on all I could see</p>

    <p class="normal0">Was Old St. Nick on that Christmas Eve.</p>

    <hr class="hr0" />

    <p class="normal0">The next poem is one I wrote a few months after breaking up with my college girlfirend.</p>

    <p class="normal0">Maybe... (1973, Age 20)</p>

    <p class="normal0">Strange sensations envelope my curiosity, it seems.</p>

    <p class="normal0">I&#x27;m curious about my feelings, about my dreams.</p>

    <p class="normal0">What is love? Who does it affect? How long does it last?</p>

    <p class="normal0">Can love be measured by distance or in an hourglass?</p>

    <p class="normal0">Perhaps my visions are just illusions of my mind</p>

    <p class="normal0">Of something I secretly want or silently desire.</p>

    <p class="normal0">Perhaps not however, perhaps love.</p>

    <p class="normal0">Perhaps it still remains through time and distance.</p>

    <p class="normal0">Likely my thoughts are just images,</p>

    <p class="normal0">Shadows, ghosts of reality.</p>

    <p class="normal0">Or maybe just passing glances at fading memories.</p>

    <p class="normal0">By chance not however, by chance love.</p>

    <p class="normal0">By chance it still remains through time and distance.</p>

    <p class="normal0">I have but one hope -- one aspiration.</p>

    <p class="normal0">That my spirit might see vividly the turth.</p>

    <p class="normal0">That surely my conception of this love is</p>

    <p class="normal0">Merely the representation of something else.</p>

    <p class="normal0">But yet there looms in the heart of my being</p>

    <p class="normal0">As if given strength by some unknown force</p>

    <p class="normal0">An entire compelling emotion, an unquestionable sensation</p>

    <p class="normal0">So genuine and authentic that it must be love.</p>

    <p class="normal0">Yet overshadowed so gravely that my feelings</p>

    <p class="normal0">Are nothing more than a recollection of events</p>

    <p class="normal0">Which have, are, and shall always elude me.</p>

    <p class="normal0">I sense not however, I sense love.</p>

    <p class="normal0">I sense it still remains through time and distance.</p>

    <p class="normal0">This next poem was originally part of a song, but the melody got lost in one of my waves of exiting brain cells and so I simply shortened it to the refrain and called it a poem.</p>

    <p class="normal0">Because Me Without You (1977, age 24)</p>

    <p class="normal0">I don&rsquo;t want you to leave</p>

    <p class="normal0">I don&rsquo;t want you to go</p>

    <hr class="hr0" />

    <p class="normal0">Because me without you</p>

    <p class="normal0">Is like a deer without a doe</p>

    <p class="normal0">It&rsquo;s like a song without a tune</p>

    <p class="normal0">Or a firefly without a glow</p>

    <p class="normal0">It&rsquo;s like a &ldquo;honey&rdquor; without a &ldquo;moon&rdquor;</p>

    <p class="normal0">Or a &ldquo;mistle&rdquor; without a &ldquo;toe&rdquor;</p>

    <p class="normal0">I don&rsquo;t want you to leave</p>

    <p class="normal0">I don&rsquo;t want you to go</p>

    <hr class="hr0" />

    <p class="normal0">Because me without you</p>

    <p class="normal0">Is like a one without a two</p>

    <p class="normal0">It&rsquo;s like a him without a her</p>

    <p class="normal0">Or a boy without a girl</p>

    <p class="normal0">It&rsquo;s like a groom without a bride</p>

    <p class="normal0">Or a husband without a wife.</p>

    <p class="normal0">This poem was one I wrote when I signed up for Matchmaker after my second divorce. There was a pretty woman&#x27;s picture on one of the profiles and I just had to meet her. I changed her name (handle) to protect the innocent.</p>

    <p class="normal0">One Face In A Thousand (1998, Age 44)</p>

    <p class="normal0">Morning comes soon and I pry open my eyes</p>

    <p class="normal0">Though your face I can still plainly see.</p>

    <p class="normal0">The Sandman and Tooth Fairy have said their goodbyes,</p>

    <p class="normal0">But your face still lingers with me.</p>

    <p class="normal0">You&#x27;re a vision to see, like a photograph still</p>

    <p class="normal0">From a dream that was blissfully blind.</p>

    <p class="normal0">Your picture so perfect, it cannot be real.</p>

    <p class="normal0">Your image stays burned in my mind.</p>

    <p class="normal0">But I wake, as I must, and I go on my way</p>

    <p class="normal0">And, I try to forget where I&#x27;ve been.</p>

    <p class="normal0">But, my mouse has a mind of its own everyday,</p>

    <p class="normal0">So, I&#x27;m reminded again and again.</p>

    <p class="normal0">Though try as I might - and I fight the good fight</p>

    <p class="normal0">I just can&#x27;t forget - I can&#x27;t win.</p>

    <p class="normal0">For winning means losing if I give up the sight</p>

    <p class="normal0">Of a twelve on a face-scale of ten.</p>

    <p class="normal0">As night finally comes and my eyes finally close</p>

    <p class="normal0">I welcome back all of my friends.</p>

    <p class="normal0">The Sandman and Tooth Fairy each strike up their pose.</p>

    <p class="normal0">Then the face that turns boys into men.</p>

    <p class="normal0">Yes, Mary is pretty and Jaclyn is fine</p>

    <p class="normal0">And, Connie is beautiful too!</p>

    <p class="normal0">But, Sheena was tops till the second in time,</p>

    <p class="normal0">That I clicked Kathy242!</p>

    <p class="normal0">There never has been, nor will ever be</p>

    <p class="normal0">A man so committed as I</p>

    <p class="normal0">To gaze on the face of the girl in my dreams</p>

    <p class="normal0">In person just once &#x27;fore I die!</p>

    <hr class="hr0" />

    <p class="normal0">Being somewhat of a pessimist, I once gave myself the challenge of coming up with one thing that represented optimism. As it turns out, it&#x27;s obvious.</p>

    <p class="normal0">The Balloon (2002, Age 49)</p>

    <p class="normal0">The image of a balloon is one of color - reds, greens, blues and yellows.</p>

    <p class="normal0">It accompanies fun, reward, anniversary, rally, newness, adventure and celebration.</p>

    <p class="normal0">It rises to the heavens as it flies above the clouds.</p>

    <p class="normal0">It knows no boundaries as it dances to the wind.</p>

    <p class="normal0">It captures our imagination while it offends no soul.</p>

    <p class="normal0">But, most of all it brings a smile to the child who holds it...</p>

    <p class="normal0">...whether black or white or brown.</p>

    <p class="normal0">And, that is the best reason why a simple balloon best symbolizes optimism...</p>

    <p class="normal0">... because our children are our best hope.</p>

    <hr class="hr0" />

    <p class="normal0">This last poem is easily my favorite. Shortly after my first divorce, my ex-stepfather (Dick Tillman) died of a heart attack on May 24, 1998 at the age of 73. One minute, he&#x27;s on top of the world, the next minute he&#x27;s no longer part of the world. The truth is that his death was relatively hard for me - almost equivalent to my own parents. And, being there one moment and unexpectedly gone the next is one of the reasons I decided I couldn&#x27;t let that happen to me.</p>

    <p class="normal0">Right after he died, I wrote this poem, put it in a frame and gave it to my ex-mother-in-law - a wonderful woman (Barb Tillman). I tried to incorporate all I could from the family to put into the poem.</p>

    <p class="normal0">The &quot;What&#x27;s half of mine is yours!&quot; reference was a classic sort of anti-Shakespeare thing that Dick used to love to do. He would take a candy bar (for instance), cut it in half and hand half to Barb and say &quot;What&#x27;s half of mine is yours.&quot; Then, he would reach over and take her half and cut it in half again and keep one of those two halves (meaning he ended up with 3/4) and say &quot;What&#x27;s half of yours is mine.&quot; I always thought that was so cute.</p>

    <p class="normal0">Dick served on The Enterprise in WWII and he was known by the term &quot;Shelter&quot; because the family knew he would always protect them.</p>

    <p class="normal0">And, finally, the &quot;2 Girls and a Sailor&quot; reference is to the movie from 1944 which was their first date.</p>
