My songs

I have written a few songs, but none since I was a teenager. Back then in the late 1960's, life was simple and almost all music was about love. As we know, music has become a lot more hard-edged since then. Can you imagine The Beatles or Elvis being controversial today?

Additionally, music was either pop, hard rock, country or blues. Nowadays, there are at least 20 different types of music - at least that's how many music channels I have on my cable system. Anyway, these songs represent that era - late 60's.

I thought seriously about singing each of these songs a capella and having the recorded verison on this site. I also thought about converting them to sheet music so that the melodies could be saved for posterity. But, I ultimately decided that my a capella days ended at least 10 years ago and, frankly it's too much work to convert them to sheet music.

My Heart’s To Blame (I arbitrarily picked the name “Kathy”)

Verse 1

There’s a girl I know

She is so beautiful

Oh, I love her so

She’s just irresistible

She’s treated me so fine

I’m about to lose my mind

She loves the rain

Kathy’s her name

Verse 2

She’s like a dream

Only I don’t wake up

The night’s moonbeam

Shows a face filled with love

She’s full of understanding

Of life and truth and our romancing

Resisting her is vain

Kathy’s her name

REFRAIN

I can’t explain my feelings

Toward her

I get lost in her sensuous excitement

Verse 3

I love to hold her hand

And gaze into her eyes

I love to touch her lips, and

Receive her warm replies

I’ve waited all my life

For someone half as nice

My heart’s to blame

Kathy’s her name

REFRAIN

I can’t explain my feelings

Toward her

I get lost in her sensuous excitement

Verse 3 repeat

I love to hold her hand

And gaze into her eyes

I love to touch her lips, and

Receive her warm replies

I’ve waited all my life

For someone half as nice

My heart’s to blame

Kathy’s her name

My heart’s to blame

Kathy’s her name

When I Knew

REFRAIN

When I knew

There was no one else but you

Then I cried

Then I tried to make my dreams come true

Through the night

No more searching without light

All your promises look bright

My troubles are few

Take my heart

Please don’t ever break it apart

Don’t leave me behind

Say you’re mine

Cause I love you.

Verse 1

I love to hold you when you’re happy

I love to comfort you when you’re sad

I love to hear you say “I love you.”

Makes me glad

REFRAIN

When I knew

There was no one else but you

Then I cried

Then I tried to make my dreams come true

Through the night

No more searching without light

All your promises look bright

My troubles are few

Take my heart

Please don’t ever let us be apart

Don’t’ leave me behind

Say you’re mine

Cause I love you.

Verse 2

I love to kiss you when you’re smiling

I love to cheer you when your blue

I love to put my arms around you

Yes, I do

REFRAIN

When I knew

There was no one else but you

Then I cried

Then I tried to make my dreams come true

Through the night

No more searching without light

All your promises look bright

My troubles are few

Take my heart

Please don’t ever let us be apart

Don’t’ leave me behind

Say you’re mine

Cause I love you.

Turn The Lights Down Low

REFRAIN

Turn the lights down low

Put your hand in mine

Let the time go slow

Kiss me one more time

I love to hold you

And tell you what you mean to me

I wish I had told you

That I didn’t want you to leave

REFRAIN

Turn the lights down low

Put your hand in mine

Let the time go slow

Kiss me one more time

I want to be able to kiss you

Whenever I feel the need

I don’t want to miss you

So why do you have to leave

REFRAIN

Turn the lights down low

Put your hands in mine

Let the time go slow

Kiss me one last time
