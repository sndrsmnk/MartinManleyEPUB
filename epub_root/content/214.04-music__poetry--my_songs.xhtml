    <h1 class="h1">Music &amp; Poetry</h1><h2 class="h2">My songs</h2>

    <p class="normal0">I have written a few songs, but none since I was a teenager. Back then in the late 1960&#x27;s, life was simple and almost all music was about love. As we know, music has become a lot more hard-edged since then. Can you imagine The Beatles or Elvis being controversial today?</p>
    <p class="normal0">Additionally, music was either pop, hard rock, country or blues. Nowadays, there are at least 20 different types of music - at least that&#x27;s how many music channels I have on my cable system. Anyway, these songs represent that era - late 60&#x27;s.</p>
    <p class="normal0">I thought seriously about singing each of these songs a capella and having the recorded verison on this site. I also thought about converting them to sheet music so that the melodies could be saved for posterity. But, I ultimately decided that my a capella days ended at least 10 years ago and, frankly it&#x27;s too much work to convert them to sheet music.</p>
    <h3 class="h3">My Heart&rsquo;s To Blame (I arbitrarily picked the name &ldquo;Kathy&rdquor;)</h3>

    <p class="normal0"><u class="u0">Verse 1</u></p>
    <p class="normal1">There&rsquo;s a girl I know<br/>
    She is so beautiful<br/>
    Oh, I love her so<br/>
    She&rsquo;s just irresistible<br/>
    She&rsquo;s treated me so fine<br/>
    I&rsquo;m about to lose my mind<br/>
    She loves the rain<br/>
    Kathy&rsquo;s her name</p>

    <p class="normal0"><u class="u0">Verse 2</u></p>
    <p class="normal1">She&rsquo;s like a dream<br/>
    Only I don&rsquo;t wake up<br/>
    The night&rsquo;s moonbeam<br/>
    Shows a face filled with love<br/>
    She&rsquo;s full of understanding<br/>
    Of life and truth and our romancing<br/>
    Resisting her is vain<br/>
    Kathy&rsquo;s her name</p>

    <p class="normal0"><u class="u0">REFRAIN</u></p>
    <p class="normal1">I can&rsquo;t explain my feelings<br/>
    Toward her<br/>
    I get lost in her sensuous excitement</p>

    <p class="normal0"><u class="u0">Verse 3</u></p>
    <p class="normal1">I love to hold her hand<br/>
    And gaze into her eyes<br/>
    I love to touch her lips, and<br/>
    Receive her warm replies<br/>
    I&rsquo;ve waited all my life<br/>
    For someone half as nice<br/>
    My heart&rsquo;s to blame<br/>
    Kathy&rsquo;s her name</p>

    <p class="normal0"><u class="u0">REFRAIN</u></p>
    <p class="normal1">When I knew<br/>
    There was no one else but you<br/>
    Then I cried<br/>
    Then I tried to make my dreams come true</p>

    <p class="normal1">Through the night<br/>
    No more searching without light<br/>
    All your promises look bright<br/>
    My troubles are few</p>

    <p class="normal1">Take my heart<br/>
    Please don&rsquo;t ever break it apart<br/>
    Don&rsquo;t leave me behind<br/>
    Say you&rsquo;re mine<br/>
    Cause I love you.</p>

    <p class="normal0"><u class="u0">Verse 1</u></p>
    <p class="normal1">I love to hold you when you&rsquo;re happy<br/>
    I love to comfort you when you&rsquo;re sad<br/>
    I love to hear you say &ldquo;I love you.&rdquor;<br/>
    Makes me glad</p>

    <p class="normal1">Turn the lights down low<br/>
    Put your hand in mine<br/>
    Let the time go slow<br/>
    Kiss me one more time<br/>
    I love to hold you<br/>
    And tell you what you mean to me<br/>
    I wish I had told you<br/>
    That I didn&rsquo;t want you to leave</p>

    I want to be able to kiss you<br/>
    Whenever I feel the need<br/>
    I don&rsquo;t want to miss you<br/>
