    <p class="normal0">Tabernacle</p>

    <p class="normal0">This isn&#x27;t so much an invention, but it was the only place on the site that I thought it would logically fit. In 1979, I built a scale model of the Hebrew Tabernacle as discussed in the Old Testament of the Bible. This was during the Exodus of the Hebrews from Egypt.</p>

    <p class="normal0">As you can see from the pictures, the entire structure was enclosed in a case for storage purposes. The top was converted into a table for display.</p>

    <p class="normal0">I cut out a viewing hole so that you could look inside. I even had a batter-powered light inside so it you could see.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
