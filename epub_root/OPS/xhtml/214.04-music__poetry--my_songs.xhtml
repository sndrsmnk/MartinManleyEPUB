    <h1 class="h1">Music &#38; Poetry</h1><h2 class="h2">My songs</h2>

    <p class="normal0">I have written a few songs, but none since I was a teenager. Back then in the late 1960&#x27;s, life was simple and almost all music was about love. As we know, music has become a lot more hard-edged since then. Can you imagine The Beatles or Elvis being controversial today?</p>
    <p class="normal0">Additionally, music was either pop, hard rock, country or blues. Nowadays, there are at least 20 different types of music - at least that&#x27;s how many music channels I have on my cable system. Anyway, these songs represent that era - late 60&#x27;s.</p>
    <p class="normal0">I thought seriously about singing each of these songs a capella and having the recorded verison on this site. I also thought about converting them to sheet music so that the melodies could be saved for posterity. But, I ultimately decided that my a capella days ended at least 10 years ago and, frankly it&#x27;s too much work to convert them to sheet music.</p>

    <p class="normal0"><u class="u0">Verse 1</u></p>
    <p class="normal1">There&#8217;s a girl I know<br/>
    She is so beautiful<br/>
    Oh, I love her so<br/>
    She&#8217;s just irresistible<br/>
    She&#8217;s treated me so fine<br/>
    I&#8217;m about to lose my mind<br/>
    She loves the rain<br/>
    Kathy&#8217;s her name</p>

    <p class="normal0"><u class="u0">Verse 2</u></p>
    <p class="normal1">She&#8217;s like a dream<br/>
    Only I don&#8217;t wake up<br/>
    The night&#8217;s moonbeam<br/>
    Shows a face filled with love<br/>
    She&#8217;s full of understanding<br/>
    Of life and truth and our romancing<br/>
    Resisting her is vain<br/>
    Kathy&#8217;s her name</p>

    <p class="normal1">I love to hold her hand<br/>
    And gaze into her eyes<br/>
    I love to touch her lips, and<br/>
    Receive her warm replies<br/>
    I&#8217;ve waited all my life<br/>
    For someone half as nice<br/>
