    <p class="normal0">I&#x27;m no poet and I know it.</p>
    <p class="normal0">Nevertheless, I&#x27;ve written a few poems that I happen to like. See what you think.</p>
    <p class="normal0">This is the first poem that I ever remember writing.</p>
    <h3 class="h3">Old Saint Nick (1966, Age 13)</h3>
    <p class="normal1">One Christmas Eve when I was sick<br/>
    I looked out my window and saw Saint Nick<br/>
    <br/>
    I ran to my bed and closed my eyes<br/>
    And, down through the chimney the old man arrives<br/>
    <br/>
    I peeked through the door and Santa Clause said<br/>
    You little sick boy, please stay in bed<br/>
    <br/>
    Five minutes later I woke back up<br/>
    And, there beside me lay a pup<br/>
    <br/>
    I could hardly sleep until Christmas day<br/>
    Even my dreams would keep me awake<br/>
    <br/>
    But, Christmas morn came and I felt so much better<br/>
    I could not wait to write Nick a letter<br/>
    <br/>
    From that day on all I could see<br/>
    Was Old St. Nick on that Christmas Eve.</p>

    <p class="normal0">The next poem is one I wrote a few months after breaking up with my college girlfirend.</p>
    <h3 class="h3">Maybe... (1973, Age 20)</h3>
    <p class="normal1">Strange sensations envelope my curiosity, it seems.<br/>
    I&#x27;m curious about my feelings, about my dreams.<br/>
    What is love? Who does it affect? How long does it last?<br/>
    Can love be measured by distance or in an hourglass?<br/>
    <br/>
    Perhaps my visions are just illusions of my mind<br/>
    Of something I secretly want or silently desire.<br/>
    Perhaps not however, perhaps love.<br/>
    Perhaps it still remains through time and distance.<br/>
    <br/>
    Likely my thoughts are just images,<br/>
    Shadows, ghosts of reality.<br/>
    Or maybe just passing glances at fading memories.<br/>
    By chance not however, by chance love.<br/>
    By chance it still remains through time and distance.<br/>
    <br/>
    I have but one hope -- one aspiration.<br/>
    That my spirit might see vividly the turth.<br/>
    That surely my conception of this love is<br/>
    Merely the representation of something else.<br/>
    <br/>
    But yet there looms in the heart of my being<br/>
    As if given strength by some unknown force<br/>
    An entire compelling emotion, an unquestionable sensation<br/>
    So genuine and authentic that it must be love.<br/>
    <br/>
    Yet overshadowed so gravely that my feelings<br/>
    Are nothing more than a recollection of events<br/>
    Which have, are, and shall always elude me.<br/>
    I sense not however, I sense love.<br/>
    I sense it still remains through time and distance.</p>

    <p class="normal0">This next poem was originally part of a song, but the melody got lost in one of my waves of exiting brain cells and so I simply shortened it to the refrain and called it a poem.</p>
    <h3 class="h3">Because Me Without You (1977, age 24)</h3>
    <p class="normal1">I don&#8217;t want you to leave<br/>
    I don&#8217;t want you to go<br/>
    <br/>
    Because me without you<br/>
    Is like a deer without a doe<br/>
    It&#8217;s like a song without a tune<br/>
    Or a firefly without a glow<br/>
    It&#8217;s like a &#8220;honey&#x201C; without a &#8220;moon&#x201C;<br/>
    Or a &#8220;mistle&#x201C; without a &#8220;toe&#x201C;<br/>
    <br/>
    I don&#8217;t want you to leave<br/>
    I don&#8217;t want you to go<br/>
    <br/>
    Because me without you<br/>
    Is like a one without a two<br/>
    It&#8217;s like a him without a her<br/>
    Or a boy without a girl<br/>
    It&#8217;s like a groom without a bride<br/>
    Or a husband without a wife.</p>

    <p class="normal0">This poem was one I wrote when I signed up for Matchmaker after my second divorce. There was a pretty woman&#x27;s picture on one of the profiles and I just had to meet her. I changed her name (handle) to protect the innocent.</p>

    <h3 class="h3">One Face In A Thousand (1998, Age 44)</h3>
    <p class="normal1">Morning comes soon and I pry open my eyes<br/>
    Though your face I can still plainly see.<br/>
    The Sandman and Tooth Fairy have said their goodbyes,<br/>
    But your face still lingers with me.<br/>
    <br/>
    You&#x27;re a vision to see, like a photograph still<br/>
    From a dream that was blissfully blind.<br/>
    Your picture so perfect, it cannot be real.<br/>
    Your image stays burned in my mind.<br/>
    <br/>
    But I wake, as I must, and I go on my way<br/>
    And, I try to forget where I&#x27;ve been.<br/>
    But, my mouse has a mind of its own everyday,<br/>
    So, I&#x27;m reminded again and again.<br/>
    <br/>
    Though try as I might - and I fight the good fight<br/>
    I just can&#x27;t forget - I can&#x27;t win.<br/>
    For winning means losing if I give up the sight<br/>
    Of a twelve on a face-scale of ten.<br/>
    <br/>
    As night finally comes and my eyes finally close<br/>
    I welcome back all of my friends.<br/>
    The Sandman and Tooth Fairy each strike up their pose.<br/>
    Then the face that turns boys into men.<br/>
    <br/>
    Yes, Mary is pretty and Jaclyn is fine<br/>
    And, Connie is beautiful too!<br/>
    But, Sheena was tops till the second in time,<br/>
    That I clicked Kathy242!<br/>
    <br/>
    There never has been, nor will ever be<br/>
    A man so committed as I<br/>
    To gaze on the face of the girl in my dreams<br/>
    In person just once &#x27;fore I die!</p>

    <p class="normal0">Being somewhat of a pessimist, I once gave myself the challenge of coming up with one thing that represented optimism. As it turns out, it&#x27;s obvious.</p>
    <h3 class="h3">The Balloon (2002, Age 49)</h3>
    <p class="normal1">The image of a balloon is one of color - reds, greens, blues and yellows.<br/>
    It accompanies fun, reward, anniversary, rally, newness, adventure and celebration.<br/>
    It rises to the heavens as it flies above the clouds.<br/>
    <br/>
    It knows no boundaries as it dances to the wind.<br/>
    It captures our imagination while it offends no soul.<br/>
    But, most of all it brings a smile to the child who holds it...<br/>
    <br/>
    ...whether black or white or brown.<br/>
    <br/>
    And, that is the best reason why a simple balloon best symbolizes optimism...<br/>
    ... because our children are our best hope.</p>

    <p class="normal0">This last poem is easily my favorite. Shortly after my first divorce, my ex-stepfather (Dick Tillman) died of a heart attack on May 24, 1998 at the age of 73. One minute, he&#x27;s on top of the world, the next minute he&#x27;s no longer part of the world. The truth is that his death was relatively hard for me - almost equivalent to my own parents. And, being there one moment and <em class="em0">unexpectedly</em> gone the next is one of the reasons I decided I couldn&#x27;t let that happen to me.</p>
    <p class="normal0">Right after he died, I wrote this poem, put it in a frame and gave it to my ex-mother-in-law - a wonderful woman (Barb Tillman). I tried to incorporate all I could from the family to put into the poem.</p>
    <p class="normal0">The &#34;What&#x27;s half of mine is yours!&#34; reference was a classic sort of anti-Shakespeare thing that Dick used to love to do. He would take a candy bar (for instance), cut it in half and hand half to Barb and say &#34;What&#x27;s half of mine is yours.&#34; Then, he would reach over and take her half and cut it in half again and keep one of those two halves (meaning he ended up with 3/4) and say &#34;What&#x27;s half of yours is mine.&#34; I always thought that was so cute.</p>
    <p class="normal0">Dick served on The Enterprise in WWII and he was known by the term &#34;Shelter&#34; because the family knew he would always protect them.</p>
    <p class="normal0">And, finally, the &#34;2 Girls and a Sailor&#34; reference is to the movie from 1944 which was their first date.</p>
