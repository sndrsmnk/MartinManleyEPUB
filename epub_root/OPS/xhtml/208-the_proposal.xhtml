    <h1 class="h1">The Proposal</h1>

    <p class="normal0">There were times when I was actually a romantic &#8211; although even being romantic was tempered by my analytical way of thinking. But, in this particular case, that made what I did in my proposal to my second wife (Teri) special &#8211; at least in my opinion.</p>
    <p class="normal0">I knew I wanted to propose to her in May, 1999, but I got a great idea. I decided to do it via a crossword puzzle. She loved to work CW puzzles and I thought it would be cool.</p>
    <p class="normal0">Years later in 2011, I heard of a person who got a professional CW writer to create a puzzle specifically for him and they worked it into the paper. The three answers in the puzzle were <em class="em0">marlowe</em>, <em class="em0">epstein</em>, <em class="em0">willyoumarryme</em>. I&#8217;m not sure what the clue was for &#8220;marlowe&#x201C; or &#8220;espstein&#x201C;, but it worked.</p>
    <p class="normal0">Mine was cooler in my opinion. We were taking a trip from May 28th to June 1st to the Ozarks in southern Missouri. I decided I wanted to propose on June 1st &#8211; the traditional first day of summer. June is also the month in which most weddings occur. May 28th was on a Friday and June 1st was on a Tuesday &#8211; which worked out perfectly.</p>
    <p class="normal0">Teri liked doing crossword puzzles because she was good at them. She was always smart &#8211; getting her degree and MBA while working full time &#8211; straight A&#8217;s. She then got her CPA. She doesn&#8217;t like me bragging on her and she will probably hate this category on this site, but what can she do about it now?</p>
    <p class="normal0">Anyway, I made up a crossword puzzle (see below) that I knew she would want to do. I made it the size of USA Today&#8217;s paper and put it in as an insert on May 28th. We took off for the Ozarks on that Friday with me driving. At some point, I handed her the USA Today. She immediately discovered the insert and started working on it.</p>
    <p class="normal0">The theme of the crossword puzzle was &#8220;The Wedding Month&#x201C; by Lyman Mintear (anagram for Martin Manley). It stated right on it that the answers would appear June 1, 1999.</p>
    <p class="normal0">I&#8217;m so obsessive about detail that I decided I had to make the crossword puzzle symmetrical, as all good CW puzzles are. Even cooler, the word &#34;symmetry&#34; is in the exact middle of the puzzle. Needless to say, that meant it took a lot of hours to create &#8211; especially when there was a theme and as many clues as possible had to relate in some way to love, romance, weddings, etc.</p>
    <p class="normal0">She completed the puzzle and then discarded it like she might with any other puzzle she worked on. Of course, when she got out of the car, I discretely saved it so that she would have it Tuesday to check the answers even if she didn&#8217;t think of it herself.</p>
    <p class="normal0">When we got back to Overland Park, Kansas on June 1st and settled in, I bought a USA Today paper and put the new insert into it. The insert showed the puzzle filled in with the answers. Below the puzzle was this:</p>
    <p class="normal0">14 Down ___ ___ ___ ,<br/>
13 Across ___ ___ ___ ___<br/>
12 Across ___<br/>
33 Across ___ ___ ___ ___ ___<br/>
87 Down ___ ___ ?<br/>
57 Across ___ ___ ___</p>
    <p class="normal0">The point was that she was supposed to fill in the answers to the clues above. When she did, they spelled out&#x2026; TLW, WILL YOU MARRY ME? MAM</p>
    <p class="normal0">TLW were her initials and MAM were mine. Foolishly, she said &#8220;yes&#x201C;.</p>
    <p class="normal8">&#34;My most brilliant achievement was my ability to be able to persuade my wife to marry me.&#34;<br/>&#x2015;Winston Churchill</p>
    <p class="normal0">Many of the answers to the puzzle were related to the theme - JUNEFIRST, SHE, ROMEOANDJULIET, SEX, LOVE, ENGAGEMENT, MARRY, LADY, HEART, BRIDEANDGROOM, SAYYES, WINEANDDINE, WOMEN, DESIANDLUCY, SUGARANDSPICE, RING, HERS, WED, IDO, AMORE, MOON, MAKEAWISH, BELLS and others.</p>
