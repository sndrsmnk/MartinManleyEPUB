    <h1 class="h1">Music &#38; Poetry</h1><h2 class="h2">Duets</h2>

    <p class="normal0">For some strange reason - no doubt the romantic in me - I liked duets - meaning mostly a man and woman. I would say that other than my obsession with <a href="214.01-music__poetry--james_taylor_et_al.xhtml">James Taylor</a>, the duets were about the only other thing that moved me musically in the 1980s and 1990s and so I started collecting them.</p>

    <p class="normal0">This might seem like it wouldn&#x27;t be that hard to do, but in those days even researching what duets had been on the charts or slipped through the cracks... and by who and how to get a copy, etc. was very difficult. Eventually, I ended with 64 (16 per CD) that I liked well enough to include in the collection. I quit adding ten years ago or so and there have been a few more that have come out since. But, this was a collection that I enjoyed putting together even more than I enjoyed listening to. The complete list can be found at the bottom of this page should you ever want to duplicate it.</p>

    <p class="normal0">As a member of our <a href="206-chancel_choir.xhtml">church choir</a> I had opportunities to sing solos in some of the songs. That was rewarding in its own way. However, the most enjoyable songs I sang were over a five-year period when we had a fund-raiser each fall (Dessert Theater). This was a night in which many of us would be involved in different types of skits. Most of the time, singing was part of it. In my case, I performed five consecutive years with five different women in the choir &#8211; all duets. Most of the performances had some element of comedy involved. I assume, of course, that my love affair with duets is why I opted to perform with another woman.</p>

    <p class="normal0">I arranged these so that when they were eventually on four CDs, the first two and last two would be my favorite four on each CD.</p>
