Tabernacle

This isn't so much an invention, but it was the only place on the site that I thought it would logically fit. In 1979, I built a scale model of the Hebrew Tabernacle as discussed in the Old Testament of the Bible. This was during the Exodus of the Hebrews from Egypt.

As you can see from the pictures, the entire structure was enclosed in a case for storage purposes. The top was converted into a table for display.

I cut out a viewing hole so that you could look inside. I even had a batter-powered light inside so it you could see.
