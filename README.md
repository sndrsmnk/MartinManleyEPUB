Martin Manley: My Life and Death
Born 8-15-53, Died 8-15-13, Age 60

    "Today is August 15, 2013. Today is my 60th birthday. Today is the
    last day of my life. Today, I committed suicide. Today, is the first
    day this site is active, but it will be here for years to come."

Unfortunately, Yahoo! thought different of the 'years to come'.
The site went offline not long after Martin Manley put it online.

At least one known mirror of the site exists and this is my first GIT
project of changing his work into an EPUB ebook.
