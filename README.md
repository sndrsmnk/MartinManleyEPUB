Unfortunately, Yahoo! thought different of the 'years to come'.<br />
The site went offline not long after Martin Manley put it online.</br />
At least one known mirror of the site exists and this is my first GIT<br />
project of changing his work into an EPUB ebook. I'm new to GIT and<br />
new to EPUB, so this is a promising project from the start. ;)<br />
I've ripped the EPUB skeleton from an EPUB file created by Calibre<br />
v1.0.0 and wish to learn about the EPUB specification as well as the<br />
workings of GIT as i go.<br />
