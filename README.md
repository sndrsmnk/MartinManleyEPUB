> "Today is August 15, 2013. Today is my 60th birthday. Today is the last day of my life. Today, I committed suicide. Today, is the first day this site is active, but it will be here for years to come."

Unfortunately, Yahoo! thought different of the 'years to come'.

The site went offline not long after Martin Manley put it online.

This is my first GIT project of changing his work into an EPUB ebook. I'm new to GIT and new to EPUBs. Any tips and hints are welcome!
